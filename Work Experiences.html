<p> I have worked a multitude of jobs so far during my adolescent years. Most recently, I have worked at the Lobster Shack in my hometown for the past two summers. It is located right next to Two Lights State Park on the southern edge of Cape Elizabeth. You can actually see the two lighthouses right from the parking lot. The Lobster Shack is known for their appetizing steamed lobsters, lobster rolls, and fried seafood, but we do offer a variety of grilled items as well. I usually man the grill or the fryers on my shifts during the opening hours, and prep work before we open for the day.<p>
<p> I have also worked at my dad's demolition company, a plow company as a shoveler, and as a basketball coach and referee for the local youth community service league. My dad's company, J. Harvey & Associates, works on houses that have either burned down or been ruined by any unfortunate event. We tear the house down, and build it right back up as fast as we can. One of the more recent houses that I have worked on was right in my hometown. During the winter, I shovel for Spiritual Workers in South Portland. Every snowstorm, I go out with one of the plow trucks that they have and shovel the stairs, walkways, and paths at the residences and companies that we have for clients.
