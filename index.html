<h1>Ryan Harvey</h1>
<h2>First-Year Student at the University of Maine</h2>

<div class="article">
<p>Welcome to my first website! I am from Cape Elizabeth, Maine. I grew up playing football and basketball, and I am an easy-going guy. I am a first year student here at the University of Maine in the Maine Business School. I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Finance with an expected graduation date of May 2021. I am a second generation student at this University, as my mom and her brother came to school here in the late 1970's. However, I am the first of my siblings to attend this university. My brother attended the University of Maryland, Baltimore County on a D-1 lacrosse scholarship in the early 2000's, while my sister attended The University of Southern Maine in Portland, Maine, a quick drive from my hometown. The links at the top of the page will guide you through a photo gallery, some information about my home town, my past work experiences, and my resume.</p>
