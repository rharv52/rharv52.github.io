<p> These are my two dogs. On the left is Bella. She is a tick hound, which is a mixed breed of a hound dog and a golden retriever. My family got her from the pound fourteen years ago and never looked back. On the right is Gypsy. Don't let the black streak on her face fool you, it's just a birthmark. She is 100% yellow lab. My family got her as a puppy when I was thirteen years old. Both of my dogs love to go for walks in the park, swim in the ponds and oceans near my house, and eat whatever they can find. </p>
